#### Technological Autonomy
* Hardware preferences
	* Mac 
	* Linux
	* AWS 



#### Technological Autonomy
* Administrative rights to own hardware
	* Trying to convince traditional IT why sklearn needs to updated,
	* or why Python paths have been corrected is HARD!
	* ... and a waste of taxpayer's time. 



#### Budget? 
* AWS for data/applications
	* API-like wrappers
	* Highly available  
* CartoDB for mapping
* Most other tools could be FOSS	



#### Transparency?
* Require (?) all code (without PII or sensitive data) to be posted to agency GitHub
