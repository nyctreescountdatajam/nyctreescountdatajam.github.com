## Machine Learning to Predict "Poor" Health Trees



#### Machine Learning
["Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look."](http://www.sas.com/en_id/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html) ~ SAS website



#### Different from Inferential Statistics! 



#### Difference
* [When you do statistics, you want to infer the process by which data you have was generated.](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning) ~ stats.stackexchange



#### Difference
* [When you do machine learning, you want to know how you can predict what future data will look like w.r.t. some variable.](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning) ~ stats.stackexchange
